# Biography

Hi!
I am a close-to-finish Ph.D student in Robotics and Computer Vision at IRI, BarcelonaTech.
My research focuses on scene understanding in Autonomous Driving situations, mainly using Deep Learning methods with LIDAR data.
I have participated in several national and european projects. Recently I have completed a research internship in Valeo
Driving Assistance Research (Germany), obtaining a wider insight about real Autonomous Vehicles, sensors and methodologies. 


I complement my background with a great passion about technology entrepreneurship. 
This, in combination with my social skills make me feel very comfortable creating and leading new projects, methods and solutions.
