# Biography

Hi!
I am a close-to-finish Ph.D student in Robotics and Computer Vision at IRI, BarcelonaTech (Institut de Robòtica i Informàtica Industrial, UPC-CSIC).
My main research focus on create new Deep Learning methods for improving scene understanding in Autonomous Driving situations.
At the moment, I am working as a research intern in Valeo Driving Assistance Research, Germany until summer 2018, so being able to deploy and test my algorithms in real vehicles and data. 

Before this, in 2012 I got a competitive "La Caixa" scholarship (1/100) for studying my M.Sc in Automatic Control and Robotics 
at the Technical University of Catalunya (UPC - Barcelona Tech) which I finished in 2014 as one of the best of my promotion.

And previous to this, I received my B.Sc in Telecommunications Engineering from the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (UAM) in 2010.
